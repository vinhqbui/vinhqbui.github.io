## Welcome to Vinh Bui GitHub Pages

My name is Vinh Bui. I am an undergrad student at UC Berkeley, focusing on Business and Industrial Analytics.
I have passion for digging data insigts and pattern. I strongly believe that if we use data correctly, we can
make the world a better place.

Here is my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinh-bui-ds/). Please connect to make friends. I would love to hear
you stories.


### My personal projects

1. ### [Gitlet](https://github.com/vinhqbui/Gitlet)


```markdown
- Gitlet is a simplified version of the famous Git.
- Utilized OOP concept to develop the software, which made the project easier to do maintenance and expand.
- Using serialization to manage the state of the gitlet.
- Emphasize on file manipulation to provide safe backup and restoration of files.
```
 
2. ### [Jump61B](https://github.com/vinhqbui/Jump61B)


```markdown
The KJumpingCube game1 is a two-person board game. It is a pure strategy game, involving no element of chance.
- Using minimax algorithm to build AI.
- Using OOP concepts to ensure maintainability of the code.
```

3. ### [The Enigma](https://github.com/vinhqbui/the-Enigma)


```markdown
This is a simulation of the Enigma machine that was used in World War 2.
- Supporting an unlimited number of rotors and an error reporting system.

- Included customized permutations and plugboard.
- Unit tests to ensure correctness at modules level.
```

4. ### [Grading Assistant Model](https://github.com/vinhqbui/Grading-Essay)


```markdown
The project's goal is to build a machine learning model that learns from previous graded essays to predict the scores of new essays.
- Use TF-IDF and SVD for processing and performing dimensions reduction of the data. K-Nearest Neighbors is applied for the learning model.
- Even though the accuracy is not as good as the neural network, but the results are more understandable for non-technical viewers.

5. ### [Jack London](https://github.com/vinhqbui/jack-london)

```
Call of the Wild is one of my favorite books. I did some analysis between characters based on their name frequencies in the chapter.
